If a module is not listed in the corresponding migration issue list, but you are seeing it migrated in the previous version, it can be due to the module arrived on the previous branch after the current version branches were created, which is the moment when the issue is created and populated with currently existing modules.

So that doesn't mean the module is not needed in new version. This has to be checked by any contribution. If it's the case, then the line for the module should be on the migration issue, but it should be crossed out by any of the maintainers.

You can ask in the issue itself for the module to be added to the list if you detect that is missing.
